This code implements a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline** for querying and evaluating events based on their semantic similarity to a given query. It combines **retrieval** (finding the most relevant data) with an **embedding-based similarity search** to perform a RAG-like operation.

Let me break it down for you step-by-step:

---

### **1. What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**
In RAG, a query is processed in two main steps:
1. **Retrieval**: Relevant data (in this case, event information) is retrieved using embeddings (dense representations of data that capture semantic meaning).
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved data is used to generate or inform results. Here, instead of generating text like in a language model, it retrieves and ranks event objects.

The pipeline essentially retrieves events based on a user's query by:
- Embedding the query and events into a semantic space.
- Comparing their embeddings for similarity.
- Returning the most relevant events.

### **2. Key Components of the Code**

#### **Event Classes and Data Structures**
- The `Event`, `EventVenue`, `EventAddress`, and `EventImage` classes represent the structure of an event and its metadata (like name, venue, date, tags, etc.).
- These use `@dataclass` for easier initialization and immutability (since theyâ€™re frozen).
- Example:
  - An `Event` includes details such as the name, venue, start time, tags, and online status.
  - Each event also has associated venue/address data encapsulated in `EventVenue` and `EventAddress`.

#### **EventbriteRAGPipeline**
This is the core pipeline where RAG is applied.

##### **a. Initialization**
- The class is initialized with a list of `Event` objects and an embedding model (`SentenceTransformer` with the default model `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`).
- The model converts the event text into dense vectors (embeddings).
- **Why embeddings?** These embeddings capture semantic meaning. Two similar pieces of text will have similar embeddings.

##### **b. `_compute_embeddings`**
- This function computes embeddings for all events.
- Each event is converted into a single text representation (combining event name, description, tags, venue, etc.).
- The embedding model (`SentenceTransformer`) converts this text into a dense vector for similarity computations later.

Example Text Representation for an Event:
```
"AI Conference 2024 Learn about AI in depth Artificial Intelligence Technology Conference New York English"
```

- The embeddings for all events are stored in `self.event_embeddings`.

##### **c. `query_events`**
This is the **retrieval step**:
- When the user provides a query (e.g., "AI conferences in New York"), the query is embedded into the same vector space as the events.
- Cosine similarity is calculated between the query's embedding and all event embeddings.
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures how similar two vectors are in high-dimensional space (ranges from -1 to 1).
  - Higher similarity = more relevant.
- The top `k` events with the highest similarity scores are returned.

---

#### **EventEvaluator**
This class helps evaluate how well the pipeline retrieves events for multiple queries.

##### **a. Initialization**
- Takes a list of user queries and the RAG pipeline as inputs.

##### **b. `evaluate_query`**
- For a single query:
  - Uses `query_events` to retrieve the top matching events.
  - Converts the event metadata into a human-readable format (name, venue, date, etc.).
- This function outputs a summary of the top events for the query.

##### **c. `evaluate`**
- Loops over all queries and retrieves events for each.
- Stores the results for each query in a dictionary.

### **3. How RAG is Used Here**
1. **Embedding-Based Retrieval**:  
   - Events and queries are represented as dense vectors (embeddings) in a shared semantic space.
   - These embeddings are computed using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model.

2. **Augmentation**:  
   - Instead of generating new content, the code "augments" the user query by finding the most semantically similar events using cosine similarity.

3. **Custom Results**:  
   - Once the relevant events are retrieved, their structured information (name, venue, time, etc.) is presented as results.

---

### **4. Practical Example**
- Suppose you have 10 events like:
  - *"AI Conference 2024 in New York"*
  - *"Music Festival in California"*
  - *"Startup Pitching Competition in London"*

- A user queries: `"Upcoming AI events in New York"`
  - The pipeline:
    1. Converts all events and the query into embeddings.
    2. Computes cosine similarity between the query embedding and all event embeddings.
    3. Returns the most similar events, e.g., *"AI Conference 2024 in New York."*

### **5. Advantages of This RAG Pipeline**
- **Efficiency**: Semantic search is faster and more flexible than keyword-based search.
- **Versatility**: Works with unstructured or loosely structured data (combines tags, descriptions, and other event metadata).
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets of events.
